1) Zach Villard ; zacharyvillard15@gmail.com

2) First time I created a repository, got confused at first due to the website's layout 
being different than described in the instructions.

3) Created my first repository very easily before moving on to the desktop version.

4) When cloning my first repository, I realized I was only capable of doing it on 
the desktop version, and it was the only way of creating a file and 
storing it into my computer hard drive.
